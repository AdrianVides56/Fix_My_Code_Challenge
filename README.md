# Fix_My_Code_Challenge

---

## Description :newspaper:
Fix my code is a project, where Iâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and fix it
This is the repository I'll be using as initial files for all solutions:
- [0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge)
The scope is to fix the code, not recode everything!
